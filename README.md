# BombPartyBot
A bomb party bot for [jklm.fun](https://jklm.fun/)
## What does it do?
When the bot is connected, it will automatically write a word when it is its turn.
## Other information + credits
- Uses the [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) python library to interact with the website
- Uses a word list (source unknown; I cannot find it) that has been very briefly manually filtered to remove any word generally & subjectively considered to be relatively bad or controversial. Obviously this removal is not exhaustive and because I only spent like 5 minutes doing so I probably missed some, so raise an issue if you really want.
## How to use
You can go to the [replit and fork it to run it yourself](https://replit.com/@matt-man/BombPartyBot), where you can see the web interface. I have not tested running this outside of repl, but you can almost definitely use it. When running the repl, the console messages will guide you how to use it.
